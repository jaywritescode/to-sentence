# to_sentence
A JavaScript port of the activesupport gem's #to_sentence method.

---

Our friendly Ruby community provides us with the wonderful `Array#to_sentence` [method](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/activesupport/Array#to_sentence-instance_method), which enhances the time-worn `#join` method with a more robust implementation that better mimicks natural language and re-opens pendantic debate over the [Oxford comma](https://thewritelife.com/is-the-oxford-comma-necessary/).

This is me attempting to fully and accurately port the Ruby method to Javascript.
